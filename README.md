# COGS189_finalProject

For this project, we plan to record the attention measure of subjects equipped
with a Neurosky headset while playing a timed round of Tetris. Our aim is to
compare these attention measures and see whether or not there is a correlation
between a subject's skill level and their attentiveness.

Here, we use a game of Tetris made with pygame provided by this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoR4ilCWwKA&t=3s
